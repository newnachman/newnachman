- 👋 Hi, I’m @newnachman
- 👀 I’m interested in web development!
- Working with REACT.JS, ANGULAR 9+, ES6 ... in client side
- Working with PHP, NODE.JS (LARAVEL, EXPRESS) in server side

- I like to create simple solutions for big problems, solutions that even a programer in its very first day will understand & like.
- i like clean code & products.
- My approach to product delivery is: simplicity in UIs, cleanliness, less is more!
- overall, I am a very sociable person,
I am better at understanding people & users (and business needs) than at writing code. that's the truth 😉😎😁.
